# mawstats
This script computes some statistics related to the concept of minimal absent words "maws", especially over maws of factors of words.

This code uses the maw sofware [1] (accessible here: https://github.com/solonas13/maw) to compute maws.
Before you install mawstats, make sure you already have maw on your computer. Then, follow instructions from file INSTALL.
